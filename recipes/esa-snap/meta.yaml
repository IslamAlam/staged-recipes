# Note: there are many handy hints in comments in this example -- remove them when you've finalized your recipe
# If your package is python based, we recommend using Grayskull to generate it instead:
# https://github.com/conda-incubator/grayskull

# Jinja variables help maintain the recipe as you'll update the version only here.
# Using the name variable with the URL in line 14 is convenient
# when copying and pasting from another recipe, but not really needed.

  summary: 'A common architecture for all Sentinel Toolboxes is being jointly developed by Brockmann Consult, SkyWatch and C-S called the Sentinel Application Platform (SNAP).'
  description: |
    The SNAP architecture is ideal for Earth Observation processing and 
    analysis due to the following technological innovations: 
    Extensibility, Portability, Modular Rich Client Platform, 
    Generic EO Data Abstraction, Tiled Memory Management, 
    and a Graph Processing Framework.
